# .lynx
My Lynx web browser config for the 21st century. This repository is made to just be ease of access for me when I am on a machine that does not have my configs.

- `bash -c "$(curl -s https://lynx.neb.cx/setup.sh)"`

.lynx should work on any *nix machine that has sudo or doas. If it does not work, just look at the script you're smart enough to figure it out.
